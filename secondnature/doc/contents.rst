Map of the problematique
========================
We want to merge Visualea and LPy. They each do different tasks but share
code. They are each different applications, with different UI approaches.
Using both in combination is not straightforward. The same applies to other
software being developped in the team that aren't exposed in any of these tools.
This situation also results in coding effort being spread in different directions and there
is also no clearly identifyable "VirtualPlants" platform.

We need to define a user interface that allows us to expose different aspects
of your daily tasks, not exclusively dataflow, not exclusively LSystems.
Be able to mix and match different tools to acheive your goals.

* One clearly identifyable but polymorphic and extensible user interface.
* A flexible resource management infrastructure to easily locate/share resources

Before really starting designing and prototyping, a :doc:`state of the art<previous_work>` was
done to hopefully give us some ideas of how to do what we want. It is all summarized in the
:download:`SecondNature presentation PDF<./_static/SecondNature.pdf>`.
